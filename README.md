![PyTrader](https://github.com/TheSnowGuru/PyTrader-python-mt5-trading-api-connector/blob/master/PyTrader-icon-small.png)

The Pytrader ecosystem consists of a python script and a MT5 or MT4 EA. 
Further for the licensing an indicator is used. 
Documentation for connecting Metatrader 5 and metatrader 4 with Python using a simple drag and drop EA.
A full suited solution and fully tested , fast and efficient. 

The communication between the python script and the EA is based on websockets.
EA is the  Server and the python script the  Client. 
It is always query(function / python script) and output(data / server).
The EA does not need to run on same computer as the python script is running on. 
On our Github link you will find the python script, the EA’s, full documentation, and a Pytrader example script showing how to call the functions.
For questions we have also a discord channel. 
In demo (without licensing indicator) also full functionality, but for a limited number of instruments 
(EURUSD, AUDCHF, NZDCHF, GBPNZD and USDCAD).
